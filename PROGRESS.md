# BrainHarbor — Progress

> **The live state of the project.** Read this first in every session (via
> `/startup`). Updated the moment an item starts, finishes, or hits a blocker —
> a fresh session must be able to resume from this file alone.
> The item definitions live in [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md).

## Current state

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | M1 — Design system & shell (M0 complete & merged) |
| **In progress** | nothing mid-flight |
| **Next up** | WI-102 Large-text toggle + a11y smoke test |
| **Blockers** | none |

## Notes for the next session

- **Nav links are intentionally dead** (WI-101): /research, /trials, /digest,
  /get-help-now render bare 404s until their items land (WI-103, M2, M4).
  Custom 404/500 + these targets must exist before anyone outside dev sees
  the site.
- **M0 fully closed 2026-07-19**: PR #1 squash-merged to `main` (ce5929d),
  `auto/M0` deleted; brainharbor.org purchased (WI-001); `.env` populated;
  NCBI + SYNC keys in user-secrets. No open follow-ups.
- Planning and design are **done** — `PLAN.md` + `docs/*.md` are the spec,
  `docs/backlog.md` is the itemized plan (M0–M4; P2a–P3 not yet decomposed).
- Solution note: SDK 10 generated `BrainHarbor.slnx` (new XML solution
  format) rather than `.sln`; `dotnet build/test` handle it fine.
- Next: `/next-item` for WI-101, or `/autopilot M1`.

## Log (newest first)

- **2026-07-19** — **WI-101 done**: design tokens (18px-base scale, AA/AAA
  palette, spacing), real `_Layout` shell (landmarks, v1 nav, footer
  disclaimer), print.css (print-to-PDF verified), WI-005 htmx demo deleted,
  WebApplicationFactory render test added. Review clean, fixes applied.
- **2026-07-19** — **M0 closed**: WI-001 done (Dan bought brainharbor.org);
  PR #1 squash-merged to `main` (ce5929d) after Dan's review; `auto/M0`
  deleted. Secrets follow-ups all resolved same day.
- **2026-07-18** — **Autopilot M0 run COMPLETE**: WI-002..WI-006 shipped on
  `auto/M0` (PR #1, draft), CI green on the tip. WI-001 `[user]` outstanding.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-006 done** (autopilot): GitHub Actions CI — build +
  test (Release) on push/PR to main, Postgres 16 service container so the
  Database-category tests run in CI too.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-005 done** (autopilot): Htmx.Net + TagHelpers (htmx
  2.0.10 vendored), demo partial with no-JS fallback (curl-verified both
  paths); Dapper `IDbConnectionFactory` (NpgsqlDataSource DI); dev
  SYNC_API_KEY set in both apps' user-secrets. ⚠️ Dan: (1) populate
  `.claude/.env` from `.env.example` (autopilot may not touch it), (2) get a
  real NCBI_API_KEY and set it in Pipeline user-secrets + `.env`.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-004 done** (autopilot): docker-compose (Postgres 16 @
  5433, named volume, healthcheck), DbUp on dev startup with 0001 baseline,
  connection string in user-secrets, DB smoke test. Verified on a fresh
  container; code review clean (fixes applied).
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-003 done** (autopilot): BrainHarbor.sln + Web (Razor
  Pages, net10.0) + Pipeline (console) + Tests (xUnit); build + test green.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-002 done** (autopilot): private repo created + first
  commit pushed. ⚠️ Note: `gh` resolves to **badsonstudios**, not `danheinz`
  (`/users/danheinz` 404s — account renamed?). Repo is at
  `github.com/badsonstudios/BrainHarbor` (private ✓, `.env` untracked ✓).
  Dan: confirm the account; then docs/references mentioning `danheinz` get updated.
- **2026-07-18** — **Autopilot M0 started** (unattended run, branch `auto/M0`).
  WI-001 `[user]` (buy brainharbor.org) skipped — Dan's item, does not gate M0.
- **2026-07-18** — Domain changed to **brainharbor.org** (from .net); all docs
  updated. WI-001 now = buy brainharbor.org.
- **2026-07-18** — Workflow installed: `.claude/` adapted from ClaudeMon
  (skills: startup, pm, next-item, check-code, review, commit-push-pr, explain,
  deep-research; agents: code-reviewer, debugger, deep-research-agent; env
  hook, scripts, settings). Backlog created: M0–M4 decomposed into 34 work
  items. This file created.
- **2026-07-18** — Architecture pivot: pipeline moved local (console app +
  Task Scheduler + Claude Code CLI, no Anthropic API key); site gets a sync
  API + admin review queue; every published summary human-approved; Hangfire
  removed. Docs updated.
- **2026-07-18** — Decisions: brainharbor.net; weekly digest; local-first dev,
  Azure deferred to M4; private GitHub repo; toolchain verified (.NET 10 SDK,
  git, Docker, gh as danheinz).
- **2026-07-12** — Aggregation-first pivot (feed + plain-language summaries is
  the v1 product; static hub moved to Phase 2). Stack changed to Razor Pages +
  htmx on .NET 10 (Htmxor dead). Full design-doc set written: PLAN.md +
  docs/{architecture, sitemap, content-pipeline, data-model, roadmap}.

<!--
Maintenance rules (for the assistant):
- Starting an item  → set "In progress" (item + timestamp + current step).
- Finishing an item → move to Log with date, one-line outcome, PR link;
  update "Next up"; check the box in docs/backlog.md.
- Blocker/stopping mid-item → record exactly where things stand under
  "In progress" + "Blockers" so a cold session can resume.
- Keep "Notes for the next session" current; prune stale notes.
- Never delete Log entries; newest first.
