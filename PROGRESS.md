# BrainHarbor — Progress

## Current state

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | M1 — Design system & shell (M0 complete & merged) |
| **In progress** | **Autopilot M1 run** (started 2026-07-19, branch `auto/M1`) — item order: WI-108 → 102 → 103 → 109 → 104 → 105 → 106 → 107 |
| **Next up** | WI-103 Helpline band + /get-help-now |
| **Blockers** | none |

## Notes for the next session

- **Approved visual design lives at `docs/design/entry-hub-handoff/`** ("Clear
  & Kind" theme + Entry Hub home, from Claude Design 2026-07-19). It is the
  visual spec for WI-108/WI-109 and restyles later feed/item work (WI-209,
  WI-306). M1 order changed: **WI-108 before WI-102** so the axe/Playwright
  smoke test runs against the final theme. Handoff URL names that differ from
  sitemap.md (/get-help, /start-here) do NOT override the sitemap
  (/get-help-now, /start). The handoff folder is not yet committed — it goes
  in with WI-108's branch.
- **Nav links are intentionally dead** (WI-101): /research, /trials, /digest,
  /get-help-now render bare 404s until their items land (WI-103, M2, M4).
  Custom 404/500 + these targets must exist before anyone outside dev sees
  the site.
- **M0 fully closed 2026-07-19**: PR #1 squash-merged to `main` (ce5929d),
  `auto/M0` deleted; brainharbor.org purchased (WI-001); `.env` populated;
  NCBI + SYNC keys in user-secrets. No open follow-ups.
- Planning and design are **done** — `PLAN.md` + `docs/*.md` are the spec,
  `docs/backlog.md` is the itemized plan (M0–M4; P2a–P3 not yet decomposed).
- Solution note: SDK 10 generated `BrainHarbor.slnx` (new XML solution
  format) rather than `.sln`; `dotnet build/test` handle it fine.
- Next: `/next-item` for WI-101, or `/autopilot M1`.

## Log (newest first)

- **2026-07-19** — **WI-102 done** (autopilot): large-text mode (22px base)
  via cookie-persisting middleware, plain-link toggle in the header (proven
  with JS disabled in Playwright); axe-core smoke tests on the shell in both
  text modes, 0 serious/critical; Kestrel dual-host test factory; CI installs
  Chromium. Review found an open-redirect blocker (protocol-relative path) —
  fixed + regression-tested; Secure cookie flag + shared URL helper applied.
- **2026-07-19** — **WI-108 done** (autopilot): Clear & Kind theme folded into
  site.css (new palette, band/card/badge tokens, 72rem container + 46rem read
  column), nav-cta pill, footer link list + ai-note, home rebuilt as Entry Hub
  (three doors → /start, /research, /get-help-now), print.css flattens the new
  surfaces incl. print-safe dot-meter ink (review Should-fix applied). Review:
  approve, no blockers. Needs Dan's visual eyeball at end of run.
- **2026-07-19** — **Design chosen & planned in**: static mock-up generated
  (`.claude/work_files/mockup/`), run through Claude Design by Dan; approved
  handoff ("Clear & Kind" + Entry Hub) moved to `docs/design/entry-hub-handoff/`.
  Backlog updated via /pm: new WI-108 (adopt theme + Entry Hub shell) and
  WI-109 (stage-badge dot-meter + feed-card partials); WI-102/103/107/209/306
  amended to depend on / reference the handoff. Next up is now WI-108.
- **2026-07-19** — **WI-101 done**: design tokens (18px-base scale, AA/AAA
  palette, spacing), real `_Layout` shell (landmarks, v1 nav, footer
  disclaimer), print.css (print-to-PDF verified), WI-005 htmx demo deleted,
  WebApplicationFactory render test added. Review clean, fixes applied.
  PR [#2](https://github.com/badsonstudios/BrainHarbor/pull/2).
- **2026-07-19** — **M0 closed**: WI-001 done (Dan bought brainharbor.org);
  PR #1 squash-merged to `main` (ce5929d) after Dan's review; `auto/M0`
  deleted. Secrets follow-ups all resolved same day.
- **2026-07-18** — **Autopilot M0 run COMPLETE**: WI-002..WI-006 shipped on
  `auto/M0` (PR #1, draft), CI green on the tip. WI-001 `[user]` outstanding.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-006 done** (autopilot): GitHub Actions CI — build +
  test (Release) on push/PR to main, Postgres 16 service container so the
  Database-category tests run in CI too.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-005 done** (autopilot): Htmx.Net + TagHelpers (htmx
  2.0.10 vendored), demo partial with no-JS fallback (curl-verified both
  paths); Dapper `IDbConnectionFactory` (NpgsqlDataSource DI); dev
  SYNC_API_KEY set in both apps' user-secrets. ⚠️ Dan: (1) populate
  `.claude/.env` from `.env.example` (autopilot may not touch it), (2) get a
  real NCBI_API_KEY and set it in Pipeline user-secrets + `.env`.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-004 done** (autopilot): docker-compose (Postgres 16 @
  5433, named volume, healthcheck), DbUp on dev startup with 0001 baseline,
  connection string in user-secrets, DB smoke test. Verified on a fresh
  container; code review clean (fixes applied).
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-003 done** (autopilot): BrainHarbor.sln + Web (Razor
  Pages, net10.0) + Pipeline (console) + Tests (xUnit); build + test green.
- **2026-07-18** — **WI-002 done** (autopilot): private repo created + first
  commit pushed. ⚠️ Note: `gh` resolves to **badsonstudios**, not `danheinz`
  (`/users/danheinz` 404s — account renamed?). Repo is at
  `github.com/badsonstudios/BrainHarbor` (private ✓, `.env` untracked ✓).
  Dan: confirm the account; then docs/references mentioning `danheinz` get updated.
- **2026-07-18** — **Autopilot M0 started** (unattended run, branch `auto/M0`).
  WI-001 `[user]` (buy brainharbor.org) skipped — Dan's item, does not gate M0.
- **2026-07-18** — Domain changed to **brainharbor.org** (from .net); all docs
  updated. WI-001 now = buy brainharbor.org.
- **2026-07-18** — Workflow installed: `.claude/` adapted from ClaudeMon
  (skills: startup, pm, next-item, check-code, review, commit-push-pr, explain,
  deep-research; agents: code-reviewer, debugger, deep-research-agent; env
  hook, scripts, settings). Backlog created: M0–M4 decomposed into 34 work
  items. This file created.
- **2026-07-18** — Architecture pivot: pipeline moved local (console app +
  Task Scheduler + Claude Code CLI, no Anthropic API key); site gets a sync
  API + admin review queue; every published summary human-approved; Hangfire
  removed. Docs updated.
- **2026-07-18** — Decisions: brainharbor.net; weekly digest; local-first dev,
  Azure deferred to M4; private GitHub repo; toolchain verified (.NET 10 SDK,
  git, Docker, gh as danheinz).
- **2026-07-12** — Aggregation-first pivot (feed + plain-language summaries is
  the v1 product; static hub moved to Phase 2). Stack changed to Razor Pages +
  htmx on .NET 10 (Htmxor dead). Full design-doc set written: PLAN.md +
  docs/{architecture, sitemap, content-pipeline, data-model, roadmap}.

<!--
Maintenance rules (for the assistant):
- Starting an item  → set "In progress" (item + timestamp + current step).
- Finishing an item → move to Log with date, one-line outcome, PR link;
  update "Next up"; check the box in docs/backlog.md.
- Blocker/stopping mid-item → record exactly where things stand under
  "In progress" + "Blockers" so a cold session can resume.
- Keep "Notes for the next session" current; prune stale notes.
- Never delete Log entries; newest first.
